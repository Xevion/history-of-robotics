# history-of-robotics

A small Vue.js based school project exploring a small segment of the history of Robotics.

See [History of Robotics](https://xevion.github.io/history-of-robotics/).

## About

This is a school project, not meant to be a literal article or historically accurate recollection of the Sojourner
and Spirit rovers.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

Deployment to GitHub pages is simple: run `npm run build`, then commit changes with `git add docs`, `git commit` and `git push`.

While not a very advanced, recommended nor creative method, it works for me. Look on Google for automated
GitHub Actions-based setups.

## Local Deployment

- Project setup
    - `npm install`
- Compiles and hot-reloads for development
    - `npm run serve`
- Compiles and minifies for production
    - `npm run build`
-  Lints and fixes files
    - `npm run lint`
- Customize configuration
    - See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
